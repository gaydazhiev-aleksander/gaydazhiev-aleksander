# Hi there 👋, I’m Aleksander Gaydajiev

I’m a young developer who loves turning ideas into real projects.  
I mainly work with **Python**, and I’m always learning new things… sometimes too many things. 😅

## 🔭 I’m currently working on
- A **top secret project 🤫**  
- Making Python do magic ✨  
- Pretending I know what I’m doing sometimes

## 🌱 I’m currently learning / interested in
- **AI / Machine Learning** 🤖  
- **Game Development** 🎮  
- **Mobile Applications** 📱  
- **Web Development** 🌐

## 💡 Fun fact
I build programs that confuse even me… and sometimes they still work 🤯💻
